# ABOUT SVM
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and even outlier detection tasks.It is used in such as text classification, image classification, spam detection, handwriting identification, gene expression analysis, face detection, and anomaly detection. 
SVMs are adaptable and efficient in a variety of applications because they can manage high-dimensional data and nonlinear relationships.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. 
Though we say regression problems as well itâ€™s best suited for classification. 
The main objective of the SVM algorithm is to find the optimal hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that can separate the data points in different classes in the feature space. 
The hyperplane tries that the margin between the closest points of different classes should be as maximum as possible. 
The dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features is two, then the hyperplane is just a line. 
If the number of input features is three, then the hyperplane becomes a 2-D plane. It becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceeds three.The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. 
This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane. 
# Advantages of SVM
# Effective in high-dimensional cases.
# Its memory is efficient as it uses a subset of training points in the decision function called support vectors.
